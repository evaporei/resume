- Led codebase migration to support our first non-EVM compatible chain (#link("https://near.org")[NEAR Protocol]).
Advocated and contributed to open source software such as:
- #link("https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node")[graph-node]: Rust node that indexes blockchain data and serves it via GraphQL;
- #link("https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli")[graph-cli]: tool for creating subgraphs, which are a programmable ETL that reduces blockchain data to a store;
- #link("https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts")[graph-ts]: AssemblyScript standard library for subgraph development.
